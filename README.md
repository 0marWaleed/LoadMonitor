# ðŸ–¥ LoadMonitor

**LoadMonitor** is a lightweight, modular web-based application designed to monitor and display system load metrics in real time. It features a Python backend that collects system information and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that presents the data in a clean and accessible interface.

This project can serve as a simple system health dashboard, educational tool for understanding client-server architecture, or as a starting point for building more advanced monitoring tools.

## Features

- Real-time system load monitoring
- Clean, minimal frontend interface
- Separation of concerns: backend (data provider) and frontend (UI)
- Easy to set up and run locally
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, no frameworks required

## Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Backend logic and system metrics collection
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the frontend interface
- **CSS** â€“ Styling the client interface
- **JavaScript** â€“ Frontend behavior and async data fetching

## How to Run

To run LoadMonitor on your local machine, follow these steps **in order**:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0marWaleed/LoadMonitor.git
2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd LoadMonitor
   python server.py
   
Then open the dashboard link

3. **Start Client file (any file from the 3 files or all 3)**
   ```bash
   python client.py

Let me know if you'd like to include a sample screenshot or a brief explanation of the server's output format as well!
